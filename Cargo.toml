# You must select how you wish the project to link to SDL2. Dynamic linking
# makes your program depend on an external shared library file (eg: `SDL2.dll`)
# being present, but it lets people upgrade their SDL2 more easily, and so you
# should prefer it unless having the entire program in just a single EXE with no
# support files is a major goal. Static linking makes your program not depend on
# the dynamic library, but it's a few MB larger as a result. SDL2 files for
# static and/or dynamic linking are generally provided by your package manager
# on Linux and Mac. For Windows, the dynamic library files are found on the SDL2
# website download page: https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php and the necessary
# files for building are provided within the crate. Note that, due to soundness
# concerns with ABI breakage in MSCV versions, the static lib files cannot be
# pre-compiled, and if you use a static link on windows the crate will have to
# build SDL2 from source.

# You must select a minimum SDL2 version to target your binding at. Lower is
# strictly better here because even if you bind to an old version you can always
# still compile against a newer version. Ubuntu 16 is 2.0.4, Debian old-stable
# is 2.0.5, Ubuntu 18 is 2.0.8, Debian stable is 2.0.9, actual latest is 2.0.10

# I'll accept a PR that sets up the features and file support for the bindings
# to work with versions older than 2.0.8 if someone wants to do that, but
# otherwise having 2.0.8 be the minimum version supported by the crate seems
# fine to me. Anyone farther back than Debian Stable is pretty far back.
