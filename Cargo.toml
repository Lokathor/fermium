# By default, we will build the crate against the pre-built bindings for

# Use this if you already have the bindgen _binary_ installed and want that to
# be invoked as part of the build process. This is much faster than using
# bindgen as a library.

# Use this if you want to build the bindgen _library_ and run it as part of the
# build process. This makes rebuilding the crate after `cargo clean` horribly
# slow, and it's not really advised, but do what you want I guess.

# This will build with a dynamic link instead of a static link. The SDL2
# "dynamic API" is enabled either way, so using actual dynamic linking is not
# particularly necessary these days.
