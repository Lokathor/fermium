# Enable this to dynamically link to SDL2. The default is to static link because
# even with a statically linked SDL2 the end user can override the SDL2 used at
# runtime (if absolutely necessary) via SDL2's "Dynamic API" system.
# https://sdl-mirror.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README-dynapi.html 
#
# WARNING: THIS DOES NOT WORK RIGHT ON UNIX SYSTEMS. If you'd like it to work on
# unix systems please submit the PR to fix the build/link process, because I
# don't know how to make the rpath work right.
dynamic_link = []

# Enabling this will completely skip the build/link of SDL2 itself. This makes
# `cargo check` and similar much faster (including rust-analyzer), but you'll
# get linking errors if you try to actually build an executable with this
# enabled (eg: a bin/bench/test).
cargo_check = []

# Not Part Of Semver! With this on, the x86_64-pc-windows-msvc target will build
# much faster by dynamically linking to a pre-built DLL that's provided within
# the crate. On other targets it will just activate dynamic linking, but as
# noted above that's generally bad because the build.rs file isn't currently
# smart enough to cope with that.
