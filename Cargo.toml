# Enable this to dynamicly link to SDL2. The default is to static link because
# even with a staticly linked SDL2 the end user can override the SDL2 used at
# runtime (if absolutely necessary) via SDL2's "Dynamic API" system.

# Enabling this will completely skip the build/link of SDL2 itself. This makes
# `cargo check` and similar much faster, but you'll get linking errors if you
# try to build an executable with this enabled (eg: a bin/bench/test).
