# By default, we will build the crate against the pre-built bindings for

# Use this if you already have the bindgen _binary_ installed and want that to
# be invoked as part of the build process. This is much faster than using
# bindgen as a library.

# Use this if you want to build the bindgen _library_ and run it as part of the
# build process. This makes rebuilding the crate after `cargo clean` horribly
# slow, and it's not really advised, but do what you want I guess.

# You can, if you want, static link SDL2 into your program. You are _strongly_
# advised to please not do this ever. Particularly on Linux and Mac you should
# not do this, because those platforms change bits frequently enough and users
# need to be able to update the SDL2 that they're using with your program. SDL2
# has never broken backwards compatibility since moving to version 2.0. It is an
# entirely irrational fear that some future update would be a breaking change,
# they follow semver and worry about compatibility as much as any Rust crate
# you've ever used. You should generally only static link to SDL2 if you are
# building on windows and trying to ship a single-file program. Even then, you
# should strongly consider not static linking to SDL2.
