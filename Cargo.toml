# Enable this to dynamicly link to SDL2. The default is to static link because
# even with a staticly linked SDL2 the end user can override the SDL2 used at
# runtime (if absolutely necessary) via SDL2's "Dynamic API" system.
# https://sdl-mirror.readthedocs.io/en/latest/README-dynapi.html 
#
# WARNING: THIS DOES NOT WORK ON UNIX SYSTEMS. If you'd like it to work on unix
# systems please submit the PR to fix the build/link process, because I don't
# know how to make the rpath work right.
dynamic_link = []

# Enabling this will completely skip the build/link of SDL2 itself. This makes
# `cargo check` and similar much faster (including rust-analyzer), but you'll
# get linking errors if you try to actually build an executable with this
# enabled (eg: a bin/bench/test).

# building the docs is a "check only" style operation.
