//! SDL's portable 2D rendering functions.
//!
//! This API supports the following features:
//! * single pixel points
//! * single pixel lines
//! * filled rectangles
//! * texture images
//!
//! The primitives may be drawn in opaque, blended, or additive modes.
//!
//! The texture images may be drawn in opaque, blended, or additive modes. They
//! can have an additional color tint or alpha modulation applied to them, and
//! may also be stretched with linear interpolation.
//!
//! This API is designed to accelerate simple 2D operations. You may want more
//! functionality such as polygons and particle effects and in that case you
//! should use SDL's OpenGL/Direct3D support or one of the many good 3D engines.
//!
//! These functions must be called from the main thread. See this bug for
//! details: http://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1995
