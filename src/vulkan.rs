  /// SDL provided the application links to a dynamic library and both it

  /// of the Vulkan functions it uses from the dynamic library using
  /// [`SDL_Vulkan_GetVkGetInstanceProcAddr`] unless you can guarantee

  /// linked to.
  ///
  /// On Apple devices, if `path` is NULL, SDL will attempt to find
  /// the `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` address within all the mach-o images of
  /// the current process. This is because it is fairly common for Vulkan
  /// applications to link with `libvulkan` (and historically MoltenVK was
  /// provided as a static library). If it is not found then, on macOS, SDL
  /// will attempt to load `vulkan.framework/vulkan`, `libvulkan.1.dylib`,
  /// followed by `libvulkan.dylib`, in that order.
  /// On iOS SDL will attempt to load `libvulkan.dylib` only. Applications
  /// using a dynamic framework or .dylib must ensure it is included in its
  /// application bundle.
