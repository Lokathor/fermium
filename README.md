# `fermium`

Rust bindings to the [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/) library, version 2.0.14

This crate bundles the source for SDL2 and then builds it for you.
In other words, you do not need to have installed SDL2 yourself.
You do need a C compiler, but everyone has one of those, even on Windows.

## Versioning

SDL2 does **not** follow SemVer.

Under SDL2's version scheme, the numbers are what SemVer would call `major.major.minor`.
In other words, 2.0.10 is a compatible API upgrade from 2.0.9, and 2.1.0 is a *breaking* upgrade from 2.0.9.

Also, as of 2.0.10, they moved to a Linux style "even numbers are releases" version.
The current stable version is 2.0.14, and the next stable version will be 2.0.16.

Because SDL2 doesn't follow SemVer, it's slightly harder for `fermium` to follow SemVer.

Since I want it to be very easy to identify what version of SDL2 is bundled in what version of `fermium`,
we use the full SDL2 release version as the major version number of this crate:

> `SDL2-2.0.14` --> `fermium-20014.0.0`

Updates *within* a `fermium` major version will all target the same SDL2 version,
and follow the normal SemVer rules.
