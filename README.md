## License

This crate uses the Zlib license, the same license that SDL2 itself uses.

* The `old-headers-only/` directory contains header files from older versions of
  SDL2 and its add-ons, for use by bindgen when needed.
* The `full-source/` directory contains all the source needed to potentially
  build SDL2 and its add-ons, for use with static linking on windows. It's not
  _literally_ the entire source tree you'd get off their website, because a lot
  of test asset files (PNGs, mp3s, etc) have been removed to keep the download
  smaller.
